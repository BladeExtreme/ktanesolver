# KTaNE Solver Library in Python
made by some guy who self-learned python lol<br>
KTaNE solver is a library full of solver for the game KTaNE. It supports vanilla and community modded modules. Currently, the module being implemented are modules that have appeared on the 'Praetorian' bomb
<br><br>
### Tutorial
---
 1. Start by importing ktanesolver2 (will change the name to ktanesolver)
 2. Assign the edgework class to a variable. Follow the documentation for the edgework class
 3. Import the modules inside the ktanesolver library using ktanesolver.modules
 4. You will be able to access all the available solver for modules. Please note that *some* modules doesn't have solver because it's either too easy, or you are able to solve it by your own without any help

### Major Update - 29/05/2024
---
Technically a major update, basically I changed the edgework class to have a new parameter called 'needy'. 'needy' is the total amount of needy modules in a bomb.
Just like mentioned before, 'total_modules' is the amount of modules in the bomb excluding the needy
